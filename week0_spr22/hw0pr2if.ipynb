    "  + It needs to include at least 5 if-based control structures:\n",
    "    + An if, elif, and else control structure (with exactly one elif)\n",
    "    + An if, elif, elif, ... and else control structure (with at least two elifs and a trailing else)\n",

    "  + So, keep in mind that, potentially, lots of people (our grutors!) will read—and run—your story (we look forward to it!) \n",
    "  + Also, please be mindful of the time you spend! The goal here is not to take a lot of time. (It's easy to let time slip away: the poptart adventure above took much longer than I originally thought it would -- and it has only _one_ control structure!)"
