The article just reminds me that languages are quite different from each other and they could show the ways how users think. My native language is Mandarin Chinese and English is my second language. One of the different things that still confuses me a lot is the response to the yes or no question with "not" in it. For example, if someone asks me "aren't you happy?". If I am happy, in Mandarin, we need to say "No, I am happy". Sounds weird, right? In English we should respond "Yes, I am happy." At that time I just realized that in Mandarin, we aim to think about the answer to the question itself, but in English we consider the fact itself. The ways we answer just show the logic the native speakers use. It is interesting to find such differences in different languages.
