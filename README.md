# CS Insights via Python
This repository includes the class materials, exercise, and projects of IST 341 CS Insights via Python, Spring 2022

### Final Project: JPX Tokyo Stock Exchange Prediction
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jpx-tokyo-stock-exchange-prediction/overview

In the final project, we aim to predict the close price change of stocks on Tokyo Stock Exchange. We would like to know the close price of a stock on day t+1 would increase or decrease on day t+2 by inputting the stock information in day t. The dataset was downloaded and executed with the ETL process to become valid training and testing data for our predicting problem. Several machine learning techniques are used to predict the result and we further study features' importance and compare their accuracy to get a close insight into the problem. Finally, we create a webpage and present our models and result.
